# # Advantages of Linear Search:
# # Linear search can be used irrespective of whether the array is sorted or not. It can be used on arrays of any data type.
# # Does not require any additional memory.
# # It is a well-suited algorithm for small datasets.
# # Drawbacks of Linear Search:
# # Linear search has a time complexity of O(N), which in turn makes it slow for large datasets.
# # Not suitable for large arrays.
# # When to use Linear Search?
# # When we are dealing with a small dataset.
# # When you are searching for a dataset stored in contiguous memory.

# Q1. What are the two phases of Heap Sort?
# The heap sort algorithm consists of two phases. In the first phase, the array is converted into a max heap. And in the second phase, the highest element is removed (i.e., the one at the tree root) and the remaining elements are used to create a new max heap.
# [11:17 AM] N Murugadoss (Unverified)
# Q2. Why Heap Sort is not stable?
# The heap sort algorithm is not a stable algorithm because we swap arr[i] with arr[0] in heapSort() which might change the relative ordering of the equivalent keys.
# [11:19 AM] N Murugadoss (Unverified)
# Advantages of Heap Sort:
# Efficient Time Complexity: Heap Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases. This makes it efficient for sorting large datasets. The log n factor comes from the height of the binary heap, and it ensures that the algorithm maintains good performance even with a large number of elements.
# Memory Usage – Memory usage can be minimal (by writing an iterative heapify() instead of a recursive one). So apart from what is necessary to hold the initial list of items to be sorted, it needs no additional memory space to work
# Simplicity –  It is simpler to understand than other equally efficient sorting algorithms because it does not use advanced computer science concepts such as recursion.
# Disadvantages of Heap Sort:
# Costly: Heap sort is costly as the constants are higher compared to merge sort even if the time complexity is O(n Log n) for both.
# Unstable: Heap sort is unstable. It might rearrange the relative order.
# Efficient: Heap Sort is not very efficient when working with highly complex data.

# do sorting using heap sort.
 
# 1. arrange these elements into binary  tree
 
# 2. swap with parent if parent is less than its child nodes
