# Given the lists of numbers below …
 
# list_one = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
# list_two = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
 
# … create a function that returns whether a list is symmetrical. 
# In this case, a symmetrical list is a list that remains the same after it is reversed – 
# i.e. it’s the same backwards and forwards.
